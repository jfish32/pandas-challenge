# pandas-challenge
In this challenge I took two data sources (schools_complete.csv & students_complete.csv) and joined them to perform further analysis.

I started by creating multiple dataframes to look at the schools total performance and metrics.  Then we looked at the performance of the schools based on type of school, based on the budget of the school and based on the size of the school.  We also looked at the performance of each grade level within the schools.  All of this was done through pandas.

CONCLUSIONS:
1) My first conclusion is that Charter schools greatly outperformed District schools, something to consider if you have kids and can choose between a Charter or District school.

2) My second conclusion is one that goes against what I would have assumed.  The schools with the lowest spending ranges per student greatly outperformed those schools that spent more per student.  I would have assumed the opposite as usually more spending = more opportunity.  As a bonus you definitely want your kids in smaller schools based on this dataset as smaller school size equated to a much higher passing rate, large schools did not perform well.

You can find my complete notebook used for analysis in the PyCitySchools folder and it is called Complete_notebook.ipynb
